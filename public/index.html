        <p>Below is a form with a series of input fields and a submit button.</p>
        <p>In priority order, your task is to do the following:
            <ol>
                <li>the form has enough markup to actually use</li>
                <li>the submit button is overridden to do an <code>HTTP POST</code> against
                <code>/api/profile/</code></li>
                <li>any existing data (as retrieved by an <code>HTTP GET</code> against
                <code>/api/profile/</code> is shown to the user for editing before they can
                override it. </li>
                <li>It should look okay.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please spend about an hour on this, however much you complete is
            fine as long as it gives us an example of your code and provides
            us with something to talk about in the interview.</p>
        <p>
            Make a zip file out of the whole folder with your results, and
            email it as an attachment to andrew@micromentor.org.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find yourself with an incomplete solution at the end of an
            hour, please write in plain English what has to get done before
            it is in a more complete point. I'll be evaluating your
            application based on both this written communication AND whatever
            code you have completed.
        </p>
        <p>
